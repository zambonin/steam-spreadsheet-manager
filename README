A Python module that outputs detailed information about a Steam library to
a JSON file.

Before using it, one must first setup a configuration JSON file with a few
items, each described below:

  Field           | Description
  ----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
  steam_api_key   | Key needed for using the Steam API, issued from [1].
  steam_login     | Username used for login on Steam services.
  steamid         | The unique, 17-digit long identifier for a Steam account.
  itad_api_key    | Key needed for using the IsThereAnyDeal.com API, issued
                  | from [4].

Optionally, one also can add the `itad_region` and `itad_country` entries,
according to [5].

SteamCMD also needs to be installed, through your favourite package manager or
manually as per [2], and your credentials cached by logging in once manually
(also in the previous link).

Finally, install Python dependencies and run the module passing the JSON file
as an argument:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python -m manager path/to/config.json
