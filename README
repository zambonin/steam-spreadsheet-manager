A Python module that outputs detailed information about a Steam library to
a Google Drive spreadsheet using `gspread`.

Before using it, one must first setup a configuration JSON file with a few
items, each described below:

  Field           | Description
  ----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
  steam_api_key   | Key needed for using the Steam API, issued from [1].
  google_api_key  | OAuth2 credentials are needed to communicate with Google
                  | Drive as per [2]. This is the absolute path for the
                  | generated service account key.
  prices_file     | Absolute path to a JSON file created and updated by the
                  | module describing how much one has paid for each game on
                  | their account.
  spreadsheet_key | Unique identifier for a Google Drive spreadsheet. It may
                  | copied from its URL.
  steam_login     | Username used for login on Steam services.
  steamid         | The unique, 17-digit long identifier for a Steam account.
  country_code    | A two-letter code that represents the currency with which
                  | games were paid in. [4]

SteamCMD also needs to be installed, through your favourite package manager or
manually as per [3], and your credentials cached by logging in once manually
(also in the previous link).

Finally, install Python dependencies and run the module passing the JSON file
as an argument:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python -m manager <config.json>
